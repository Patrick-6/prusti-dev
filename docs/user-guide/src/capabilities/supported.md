# Prusti capabilities

- Good integration with standard Rust tooling, invokation of Prusti works in the same way as invoking Cargo or rustc
- Error messages are provided in the same way as in normal Rust compilation
  - Messages shown inlined in source code with Prusti-Assistant VSCode extension
- Prusti can verify either individual Rust files, entire Cargo projects and also Cargo workspaces containing multiple crates
- Can verify generic and non-generic functions and types
- Prusti can check any assertion either never fails or is unreachable
- Prusti can check if any integer operation might overflow
- Additional verification syntax usable in specifications (Pre-/Postconditions, `prusti_assert`, `prusti_assert_eq`, `prusti_assert_ne` macros):
  - Quantifiers (forall, exists)
  - `old` to refer to state of a variable before a function call
  - `snap` to take snapshots of references to work around the borrow checker inside specifications
  - snapshot equality `===` and inequality `!==` to compare values that do not implement `PartialEq`
  - left, right and two-sided implication operators: `<==`, `==>`, `<==>`
- Code with Prusti annotations can still be compiled directly with normal rustc
  - Prusti annotations are automatically removed at compile time using the Rust macro system
- Can get counterexample printed for failing assertions
- External code can still be used in verification by writing an `extern_spec` for it
- Can verify functions returning mutable references using `pledges`
